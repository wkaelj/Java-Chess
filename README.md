# Java-Chess
Java chess is a fully working chess game programmed from scratch in java.

# How to play
To move a piece, click in the peice you want to move and then click again where you want to move it.
To castle, click on the king and then on the rook you would like to castle to.
The game does not check if the player is in check, you must do that yourself.

# How to build
I have no clue how to compile it, use eclipse or just go with the precompiled jar (https://github.com/wkaelj/Java-Chess/releases/)
